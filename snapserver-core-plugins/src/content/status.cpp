/** \typedef uint32_t path_info_t::status_t::status_type
 * \brief Basic status type to save the status in the database.
 *
 * This basic status is used by the content plugin to manage a page
 * availability. It is called "basic" because this feature does not
 * use the taxonomy to mark the page as being in a specific status
 * that the end user has control over.
 *
 * By default a page is in the "normal state"
 * (path_info_t::status_t::NORMAL). A normal page can be viewed as
 * fully available and will be shown to anyone with enough permissions
 * to access that page.
 *
 * A page can also be hidden from view (path_info_t::status_t::HIDDEN),
 * in which case the page is accessible by the administrators with enough
 * permissions to see hidden pages, but no one else who instead gets an
 * error (a "404 Page Not Found" error.)
 *
 * When the user changes the path to a page, the original path is marked
 * as path_info_t::status_t::MOVED. This allows us to automatically
 * generate a redirect since the destination is saved in the original
 * page.
 *
 * A deleted page (path_info_t::status_t::DELETED) is similar to a normal
 * page, only it is found in the trashcan and thus it cannot be edited or
 * viewed. It can only be "undeleted" (cloned back to its original
 * location or to a new location in the \em regular tree.)
 */

/** \var path_info_t::status_t::error_t::NO_ERROR
 * \brief The page is valid.
 *
 * When creating a new status object, we mark it as a "no error" object.
 * Generatlly, this represents a valid page if the state is not set
 * to path_info_t::status_t::state_t::UNKNOWN_STATE.
 *
 * In this state a status can be saved to the database. If not in this
 * state, trying to save the status will fail with an exception.
 */

/** \var path_info_t::status_t::error_t::UNSUPPORTED
 * \brief Read a status that this version does not understand.
 *
 * This value is returned by the get_status() function whenever a path
 * to a page returns a number that the current status implementation does
 * not understand.
 *
 * Unfortunately, such status cannot really be dealt with in any other way.
 */

/** \var path_info_t::status_t::error_t::UNDEFINED
 * \brief The state is not defined in the database.
 *
 * This value is returned by the get_status() function whenever a path
 * to a non-existant page is read.
 *
 * This is similar to saying this is a 404. There is no redirect or anything
 * else that will help in this circumstance.
 *
 * \note
 * If the content::primary_owner field exists but no content::status field,
 * then the error status is set to error_t::NO_ERROR and the state uses
 * state_t::CREATE.
 */

/** \var path_info_t::status_t::state_t::UNKNOWN_STATE

 *
 * This value is used internally to indicate that the status was not yet
 * read from the database. It should never be saved in the database itself.
 *
 * This is used in the status_t class up until the status gets read from
 * the content table.

/** \var path_info_t::status_t::state_t::CREATE

 */

/** \var path_info_t::status_t::state_t::HIDDEN
 * \brief The page is currently hidden.
 *
 * A hidden page is similar to a normal page, only it returns a 404 to
 * normal users.

 * Only administrators with the correct permissions can see the page.
 */

/** \var path_info_t::status_t::state_t::MOVED
 * \brief This page was moved, users coming here shall be redirected.
 *
 * This page content is still intact from the time it was cloned and it
 * should not be used. Instead, since it is considered moved, it generates
 * a 301 (it could be made a 302?) so that way the users who had links to
 * the old path still get to the page.
 *
 * A moved page may get deleted at a later time.
 */

/** \var path_info_t::status_t::state_t::DELETED
 * \brief This page was deleted (moved to the trash).
 *
 * A page that gets moved to the trashcan is marked as deleted since we
 * cannot redirect someone (other than an administrator with enough
 * permissions) to the trashcan.
 *
 * Someone with enough permission can restore a deleted page.
 *
 * A page marked as deleted is eventually removed from the database by
 * the content backend. Pages in the trashcan are also eventually deleted
 * from the database. That depends on the trashcan policy settings.
