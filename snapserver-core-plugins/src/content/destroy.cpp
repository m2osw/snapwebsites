/** \brief Destroy a page.
 *
 * \warning
 * This function DESTROYS a page RECURSIVELY. So the specified page and
 * all the children of that page will ALL get DESTROYED.
 *
 * This function can be used to DESTROY a page.
 *
 * 99.99% of the time, you should use the trash_page() function which
 * will safely move the existing page to the trashcan and destroy the
 * data only at a later time.
 *
 * In many other systesm, this function would probably be just called
 * delete_page(). However, in our case, we wanted to clearly stress
 * out the fact that this function is to be used as a last resort in
 * very very few cases.
 *
 * For example, you are a programmer and you created 1,000 pages by
 * mistake and just want to get rid of them without having to delete
 * the whole database and restart populating your database. That's
 * an acceptable use case of this function.
 *
 * \warning
 * DO NOT USE THIS FUNCTION. This function destroys a page and may
 * create all sorts of problems as a result. Many pages are necessary
 * for all sorts of reasons and just destroying them may generate
 * side effects in the code that are totally unexpected. Look into
 * using trash_page() instead.
 *
 * \bug
 * There is no locking mechanism. If some other process accesses the
 * page while it is being deleted, unexpected behavior may result.
 *
 * \bug
 * The deletions scans the ENTIRE revision and branch tables to find
 * all the entries to delete for a given page. This is SLOW.
 *
 * \bug
 * The deletion of children uses recursion on the stack. A website
 * with a very large number of children could use a lot of memory
 * for this process.
 *
 * \note
 * This signal is used by the content plugin itself to make the trashed
 * pages disappear after a certain amount of time. This applies to
 * both: the original page and the page in the trashcan. It may first
 * apply to the original page quickly (within a day or two) and then
 * to the trashed page after some time (we may actually add a minimum
 * amount of time the page would stay in the trashcan such as 2 months
 * and then it gets destroyed.) By default, trash is never deleted.
 * It is kept in the trashcan forever (which is the safest thing we
 * can do.)
 *
 * \param[in] ipath  The path to the page to destroy.
 *
 * \return This function always returns true.
