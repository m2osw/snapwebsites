/** \brief Get an invoice status.
 *
 * This function reads the invoice status and returns it.
 *
 * A page that was never marked as an invoice will not have a status.
 * In that case the function returns
 * name_t::SNAP_NAME_EPAYMENT_INVOICE_STATUS_UNKNOWN.
 *
 * When you create a page which represents an invoice, you should set
 * the invoice status to created as in:
 *
 * \code
 *    epayment::epayment::instance()->set_invoice_status(invoice_ipath,
 *           epayment::epayment::name_t::SNAP_NAME_EPAYMENT_INVOICE_STATUS_CREATED);
 * \endcode
 *
 * It is VERY IMPORTANT to call the function since it is a signal and other
 * plugins may be listening to that signal and react accordingly.
 *
 * The statuses are defined here:
 *
 * \li name_t::SNAP_NAME_EPAYMENT_INVOICE_STATUS_ABANDONED
 *            -- the payment failed too many times and the invoice was
 *               finally abandoned meaning that no more attempts to make
 *               a payment against that invoice shall happen
 * \li name_t::SNAP_NAME_EPAYMENT_INVOICE_STATUS_CANCELED
 *            -- the invoice was void in some ways; either the customer
 *               decided to not process the payment at all or the customer
 *               decided to cancel later in which case he was reimbursed;
 *               it could also be used when a payment is attempted too
 *               many times and fails each time (i.e. 3 attempts...)
 * \li name_t::SNAP_NAME_EPAYMENT_INVOICE_STATUS_COMPLETED
 *            -- the invoice was paid and the shipping processed; this
 *               status is most often not used when there is no shipping
 *               (i.e. an online service); payment wise, COMPLETED also
 *               means that the products/services were PAID
 * \li name_t::SNAP_NAME_EPAYMENT_INVOICE_STATUS_CREATED
 *            -- the invoice was just created; it is brand new and was
 *               not yet paid; it also means a payment was not attempted
 * \li name_t::SNAP_NAME_EPAYMENT_INVOICE_STATUS_FAILED
 *            -- the customer attempted a payment and it failed; the
 *               customer is allowed to try again; however, auto-repeat
 *               is now turned off against that invoice
 * \li name_t::SNAP_NAME_EPAYMENT_INVOICE_STATUS_PAID
 *            -- the payment was received in full (we do not currently
 *               support partial payments, if you want to offer partial
 *               payments, you need to create multiple invoices)
 * \li name_t::SNAP_NAME_EPAYMENT_INVOICE_STATUS_PENDING
 *            -- the payment request was sent to a processor and we are
 *               waiting for the reply by the processor; this status is
 *               not always used; (TBD: we probably should include a way
 *               to save the date when that started)
 * \li name_t::SNAP_NAME_EPAYMENT_INVOICE_STATUS_PROCESSING
 *            -- the payment is being processed; this is generally used
 *               by processors that send users to an external website
 *               where they enter their information before doing their
 *               payment; this is different from pending because the
 *               customer has to act on it whereas pending means it is
 *               all automated
 * \li name_t::SNAP_NAME_EPAYMENT_INVOICE_STATUS_UNKNOWN
 *            -- when checking a page with an epayment::status which is
 *               not one of the accepted statuses, this is returned
 *
 * \todo
 * As we extend functionality, we will add additional statuses. For
 * example, in order for a customer to get reimbursed, we may need
 * intermediate states similar to PROCESSING and PENDING, which
 * represent a state in wait of the reimbursement being worked on.
 *
 * \param[in] invoice_ipath  The path to the invoice.

/** \brief Signal used to change the invoice status.
 *
 * Other plugins that want to react whenever an invoice changes its status
 * can make use of this signal. For example, once an invoice is marked PAID
 * and the cart included items that need to be shipped, the corresponding
 * plugin can make the invoice visible to the administrator who is
 * responsible for the handling.
 *
 * Another example is about users who purchase software. Once the invoice
 * is marked as PAID, the software becomes downloadable by the user.
 *
 * The list of invoice statuses is defined in the get_invoice_status()
 * function.
 *
 * \note
 * Although name_t::SNAP_NAME_EPAYMENT_INVOICE_STATUS_UNKNOWN is considered a
 * possible status when you do a get_status(), you cannot actually set
 * an invoice to that status. If an invoice is somehow "lost", use the
 * canceled status instead: name_t::SNAP_NAME_EPAYMENT_INVOICE_STATUS_CANCELED.
 *
 * \todo
 * We need to see whether we want to enforce only legal status changes.
 * For example, a PAID invoice cannot all of a sudden be marked as
 * PENDING. At this point we let it go to see whether it should be
 * allowed to happen in some special situations.
 *
 * \exception snap_logic_exception
 * This exception is raised when the function is called with an invalid
 * status.
