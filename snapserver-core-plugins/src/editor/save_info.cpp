 *
 * This constructor saves the concerned ipath and the corresponding
 * revision, secret, and draft rows.
 *
 * The class also holds a "modified" flag, which is false by default.
 * The editor_save() function changes that flag to true when it finds
 * that a field changed. You may also change it within your own
 * implementation of the save_editor_fields() signal. That will force
 * the editor to mark the data as modified by changing LAST_MODIFIED
 * fields and calling the necessary functions.
 *
 * The class also holds a flag to know whether a validation generated
 * an error. That flag is protected and it cannot be changed after
 * the validation ran. If true, then an error occurred and some or
 * all of the data of this form may be invalid.
 *
 * \todo
 * Look into moving the determination of the revision, secret, and
 * draft rows to this class instead of the editor_save() function.
 *
 * \param[in] p_ipath  The path to the page being saved.
 * \param[in] p_revision_row  The row to access the revision data.
 * \param[in] p_secret_row  The row to access secret data.
 * \param[in] p_draft_row  The row to access the data saved as a draft
 * (i.e. on errors data is saved in the draft_row instead of the revision
 * or secret row)
