/** \file
 * \brief Session handling.
 *
 * Sessions are used to track anonymous and logged in users. Especially,
 * the users plugin make use of sessions.
 *
 * The "form" and "editor" plugins use sessions too so as to avoid robots
 * that just POST content. This is because a form includes a session
 * reference which changes for each user each time a form is loaded.
 * If a robot just sends a POST, it will not have a valid session
 * reference and it will be refused.
 *
 * Other plugins are welcome to make use of sessions, although, if possible
 * any data to carry for a user over multiple accesses should make use of
 * the attach_to_session() and detach_from_session() functions available in
 * the "users" plugin.
 *
 * Sessions include four main things:
 *
 * \li The plugin name, an identifier, a key, a random number
 *
 * We expect the name of the plugin owning this session (i.e. when
 * the "users" plugin creates a session, it saves "users" as the
 * owner of that session.) This allows for the session plugin to
 * be used with any plugin and still be safe by distinguishing
 * whether a certain session is owned by such and such plugin.
 *
 * The plugin is also expected to define an identifier for the
 * session. This identifier can be used by the plugin to know what
 * the session represents (i.e. the "users" plugin used that
 * identifier to know which form it was dealing with when receiving
 * a POST back from the client.)
 *
 * Further a session includes an object path and a page path. However,
 * this may not really define the unicity of the session.
 *
 * The session plugin creates a unique key with the create_session()
 * function. This is used as the key to access the session again later.
 * (i.e. the key used to index the session in the database). This is
 * the key saved in your \<input> tag, a session attribute for the
 * "editor" plugin, the cookie for a user cookie.
 *
 * The size of the session key depends on the type of session you
 * choose to use.
 *
 * The session key is accompagned by a random number. Only at this point
 * we ignore the random number because in most cases it does not work very
 * well (i.e. the cookie does not always get properly updated and as a
 * result the client may hit the server with the wrong random number. This
 * is a problem when you do multiple accesses and all replies do not happen
 * before further calls are made and as a result some requests may include
 * the old random number.) We may look into fixing this problem at some
 * point because having a random number allows us to make long term
 * sessions much safer.
 *
 * \li Client Unicity Parameters
 *
 * In order to better identify the client, we save the client Agent
 * string. We know that the agent string may change between accesses,
 * however, we enforce it in some circumstances. For example, a user
 * who registers an account using Firefox, cannot then finish the
 * creation of the account using Chrome, the Agent string will change
 * and the second access will be refused.
 *
 * In long term session, the agent can be used to make sure that the
 * type of browser does not change. However, we cannot match the
 * string one to one because the versions are likely to change once
 * in a while.
 *
 * \li A time limit
 *
 * We actually handle several time fields to limit various things in a
 * session.
 *
 * * First we have a relative time, see set_time_to_live(), which is used
 *   to define the TTL to use in the Cassandra database. By default, this
 *   value is set to five minute.
 *  
 *   The user plugin changes this value to one year because we try to keep
 *   user sessions as long as possible. The one year limit comes from the
 *   fact that a cookie cannot last more than one year, as per HTTP 1.1.
 *  
 *   Note that a user session may be given a new identifier once in a while
 *   even when it did not yet time out as per this TTL information.
 *
 *   This parameter can be set to zero, in which case the time limit will
 *   be used instead. If both, the time limit and the TTL are zero, then
 *   the limit reverts back to the default five minutes.
 *
 * * Second we have a time limit. This is a date at which the session
 *   is considered out of date. This does not prevent you from using the
 *   session, only the user cannot write permanent, public, or
 *   administrative data to the database anymore. We use long sessions so
 *   that way we can keep track of certain data a user enters while not
 *   logged in such as his cart or various other choices on the website.
 *   Once the user logs in, that data can be saved in his account more
 *   permanently if necessary.
 *  
 *   If the time limit represents a date further in the future than
 *   "now + TTL", then the TTL is pushed back to match the time limit.
 *   In other words, the time limit is authoritative over the TTL.
 *
 * * Third we have a logged in date. This date is a short period for
 *   which the user is logged in as an administrator. You reach this
 *   state either with a special login form or every time you re-log
 *   in. This time is not updated when you hit the website. It can
 *   only be extended when a user re-log in.
 *
 *   The logged in date is clamped to the time limit if it is larger.
 *
 * * Forth we save the date when the session is last saved in the database.
 *   This can be retrieved with the sessions::session_info::get_date()
 *   function. Although you can change this value with the set_date(),
 *   the save_session() function ignores it. It always makes use of the
 *   snap_child::get_start_date() when saving that field in the database.
 *
 * \li User data fields.
 *
 * A session can be used to save your own data linked with the user or
 * other object that is linked with this session (like a form).
 *
 * The "sessions" plugin offers three functions to deal with such data:
 *
 * * attach_to_session() saves the specified data to the session. The
 *   name is expected to be a valid field name (i.e. the name of your
 *   plugin as the namespace two colons and the name of the field.)
 *   For example, the "users" plugin saves the HTTP REFERER in case
 *   we need to ask for the user log in to continue. That way we can
 *   send the user right back where he was.
 *
 * * detach_from_session() reads the specified data from the session
 *   and removes it from the session (i.e. read ONCE.) This is the
 *   opposite of the attach_to_session(). It removes the value from
 *   the session assuming that you do not need it anymore once done.
 *   The returned value is equal to the last value that was saved
 *   using the attach_to_session() with the name.
 *
 * * get_from_session() reads the specified data from the session,
 *   but keeps the value in the session for later reads. This is used
 *   to check a value from a session, but keep it for later.

/** \brief Generate a new session key.

 * a random session number. The cookie name is defined in the `sites` table
 * and is randomly generated too. The format of the cookie data is:
 *
 * \code
 * <session key>/<random>
 * \endcode
 *
 * In most cases, you do not want to change the session identifier. This gives
 * you a way to keep track of the same user for a long time. However, any time
 * a user logs in and to avoid session fixation, we need to change the
 * identifier (even though we use an HTTP-Only Secure cookie, it does not
 * prevent potential man in the middle problems.)
 *
 * Any even that you judge as being important enough that a new session
 * identifier would make sense, call this function.
 *
 * To be able to call this function, the type of the session must be
 * properly defined and be one of:
 *
 * \li session_info::session_info_type_t::SESSION_INFO_SECURE
 * \li session_info::session_info_type_t::SESSION_INFO_USER
 * \li session_info::session_info_type_t::SESSION_INFO_FORM
 *
 * A session you reload from the database will have a session type which
 * shows as an error or "Valid". To reassign a new key to such a session,
 * you must make sure to changing the session info type.
 *
 * \note
 * The function resets the creation date to 0 since in effect, creation
 * a new key is very much the same as creating a new session and therefore
 * we need a new creation date and this is done by setting it to 0 here
 * so it actually gets saved in the save_session() function.
 *
 * \attention
 * Note that the functionality may fail if the browser continues to use the
 * old cookie for a few requests just after it sent the login and we replied
 * for a new page. It may be required to sleep a little to make sure the
 * browser doesn't continue to use the old session identifier. However, this
 * should work as long as you make changes at the time an HTML page is being
 * loaded (opposed to a time when an image, icon, sound, CSS, JS, etc.file
 * gets loaded.)
 *
 * \warning
 * The caller is responsible for canceling the existing session and
 * saving the new session to the database. The session_info can't be
 * responsible for such.
 *
 * \return The function returns a copy of the new session key.

 * the create_session() or loaded by the load_session() function.
 *
 * The function returns the session identifier which includes letters
 * and digits (A-Za-z0-9).
 *
 * The session must include a path (either the page or object path as
 * defined in the session \p info parameter.) This path is used as the
 * key to access the session information. It is also the path used to
 * verify the session again when necessary. If both, the page and the
 * object are defined, then the page has priority and it becomes the
 * session database key.
 *
 * \note
 * The info receives the result key that you can later retrieve using
 * the get_session_key(). The key does NOT include the website URI.
 *
 * \note
 * The bit size of the source of the entropy (random values) is more
 * important than the bit size of the actual session token. For example,
 * an MD5 hash produces a 128 bit value. However, the MD5 hash of
 * incremental values, a timestamp, or 8-bit random numbers are each
 * insecure because the source of the random values can be easily predicted.
 * Consequently, the 128 bit size does not represent an accurate measure
 * of the session token. The minimum size of the entropy source is 32 bits,
 * although larger pools (48 or 64 bits) may be necessary for sites with
 * over 10,000 concurrent users per hour.
 *
 * \warning
 * The function checks that the time the session will live is over 1
 * minute. Anything smaller than that and you get a throw.
 *

 * context to know which randomizer to use. We should look into forcing

/** \brief Save the session.
 *
 * If you loaded a session, or created a session and made changes to
 * the session parameters (using one of the set_...() functions) then
 * you'll have to save the session again by calling this function.
 *
 * Forgetting to save the session has two side effects:
 *
 * \li All your changes are lost
 * \li The session deadline is not reset to match the time and date
 *     when those last changes were made and thus the session will
 *     be deleted early
 *
 * Note that the random session key is regenerated each time you call
 * this function (hence the \p info parameter is an in,out parameter.)
 *
 * By default the new_random flag should be true because it makes sense to
 * generate a new random session number on each access by the client.
 * However, that assumes that the user accesses the website in a very
 * serialized manner and even if the user doesn't open 3 windows at the
 * same time, that won't work because we server ALL the data (i.e. HTML,
 * JavaScript, CSS, Images, etc.) and browsers tend to send the requests
 * in parallel (Firefox has 2 at this time, but Chrome can have many more.)
 * Since we cannot really know whether the request is for a new HTML page
 * or any other part of a web page, it is just not really possible to
 * send a new random number everytime.
 *
 * There are two reasons to send a new random number:
 *
 * \li The user logs in at some level (we can have multiple log in levels!)
 * \li The user was inactive for long enough (i.e. over a minute?)
 *
 * \todo
 * Do some tests and see whether we can change the time_limit and TTL
 * values to zero after we did a load_session() and before we do a
 * save_session(). If it is possible, then we have to check that special
 * case in the save_session() function (it is checked in the create_session()
 * but not here!) because the load_session() hopes that this is always true.
 *
 * \param[in,out] info  The session info to save.
 * \param[in] new_random  Whether the session should be given a new random number.

/** \brief Load a session previously created with create_session().
 *
 * This function loads a session that one previously created with the
 * create_session() function.
 *
 * The info parameter gets reset by the function, which means that all
 * the input values are overwritten. It then sets the session type to
 * one of the following values to determine the validity of the data:
 *
 * \li SESSION_INFO_VALID -- the session is considered valid and it can
 * be used safely; the session info is perfectly valid
 *
 * \li SESSION_INFO_MISSING -- the session is missing; in most cases this
 * is because a hacker attempted to post a session and it was already
 * discarded (i.e. the hacker is reusing the same identifier over and
 * over again) or the hacker used a random number that doesn't exist in
 * the database; the session info is not valid
 *
 * \li SESSION_INFO_USED_UP -- the session was already used; it is not
 * possible to re-use it again; the session info is otherwise valid
 *
 * \li SESSION_INFO_INCOMPATIBLE -- the session is not compatible as some
 * parameters do not match the expected values; this can be set by the
 * caller (at this point this very function doesn't use this error code);
 * the session info is other valid
 *
 * \warning
 * You must check the session type before checking any of the other session
 * parameters. If the type is not VALID then the other parameters are
 * likely not defined or may have erroneous information.
 *
 * \todo
 * The use_once flag of this function has the side effect of completely
 * deleting a session. There is one problem with that and hackers wannabe...
 * If a hacker checks many sessions with say /verify/\<session-id>, the
 * result is that those sessions get deleted (so the verification fails
 * as expected, but the session may have been necessary for some other
 * reason...) Something to think about! One way to avoid some problems
 * would be to request that the session be at least of the right type
 * (i.e. right path for example). Then we can avoid the delete if the
 * type does not match and the other user can have his session.
 *
 * \param[in] session_key  The session key to load, on input the key does not include the URI.
 * \param[out] info  The variable where the session variables get saved.
 * \param[in] use_once  Whether this session can be used more than once.
