 * Description:
 *      Reads and describes a Snap database. This ease checking out the
 *      current content of the database as the cassandra-cli tends to
 *      show everything in hexadecimal number which is quite unpractical.
 *      Now we do it that way for runtime speed which is much more important
 *      than readability by humans, but we still want to see the data in an
 *      easy practical way which this tool offers.
 *
 *      This contains the main() function.
