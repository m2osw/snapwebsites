 * Description:
 *      A daemon to synchronize processes between any number of computers
 *      by blocking all of them but one.
 *
 *      The ticket class is used to know which computer is next. All
 *      computers are given a number. The computer with the smallest
 *      number has priority in case multiple computers are assigned
 *      the same ticket number.
 *
 *      This algorithm is called the Lamport's Bakery Algorithm.

/** \class snaplock_ticket
 * \brief Handle the ticket messages.
 *
 * \section introduction Introduction
 *
 * This class manages the Leslie Lamport's Bakery Algorithm (1974) lock
 * mechanism (a critical section that we can get between any number
 * of threads, processes, computers.) Details of this algorithm can
 * be found here:
 *
 *   http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lamport's_bakery_algorithm
 *
 * The algorithm requires:
 *
 * \li A unique name for each computer (server_name)
 * \li A unique number for the process attempting the lock
 *     (see gettid(2) manual)
 * \li A user supplied object name (the name of the lock)
 * \li A ticket number (use the largest existing ticket number + 1)
 *
 * We also include a timeout on any one lock so we can forfeit the
 * lock from happening if it cannot be obtained in a minimal amount
 * of time. The timeout is specified as an absolute time in the
 * future (now + X seconds.) The timeout is given in seconds (a
 * standard time_t value).
 *
 * This class sends various messages to manage the locks.
 *
 *
 * \section bakery_algorithm The Bakery Algorithm Explained
 *
 * The bakery algorithm is based on the basic idea that a large number
 * of customers go to one bakery to buy bread. In order to make sure
 * they all are served in the order they come in, they are given a ticket
 * with a number. The ticket numbers increase by one for each new customer.
 * The person still in line with the smallest ticket number is served next.
 * Once served, the ticket is destroyed.
 *
 * \note
 * The ticket numbers can restart at one whenever the queue of customers
 * goes empty. Otherwise it only increases. From our usage in Snap, it is
 * really rare that the ticket numbers would not quickly be reset,
 * especially because we have such numbers on a per object_name basis
 * and thus many times the number will actually be one.
 *
 * On a computer without any synchronization mechanism available (our case)
 * two customers may enter the bakery simultaneously (especially since we
 * are working with processes that may run on different computers.) This
 * means two customers may end up with the exact same ticket number and
 * there are no real means to avoid that problem. However, each customer
 * is also assigned two unique numbers on creation: its "host number"
 * (its server name, we use a string to simplify things) and its process
 * number (we actually use gettid() so each thread gets a unique number
 * which is an equivalent to a pid_t number for every single thread.)
 * These two numbers are used to further order processes and make sure
 * we can tell who will get the lock first.
 *
 * So, the basic bakery algorithm looks like this in C++. This algorithm
 * expects memory to be guarded (shared or "volatile"; always visible by
 * all threads.) In our case, we send the data over the network to
 * all the snaplock processes. This is definitely guarded.
 *
 * \code
 *     // declaration and initial values of global variables
 *     namespace {
 *         int                   num_threads = 100;
 *         std::vector<bool>     entering;
 *         std::vector<uint32_t> tickets;
 *     }
 *
 *     // initialize the vectors
 *     void init()
 *     {
 *         entering.reserve(num_threads);
 *         tickets.reserve(num_threads);
 *     }
 *
 *     // i is a thread "number" (0 to 99)
 *     void lock(int i)
 *     {
 *         // get the next ticket
 *         entering[i] = true;
 *         int my_ticket(0);
 *         for(int j(0); j < num_threads; ++j)
 *         {
 *             if(ticket[k] > my_ticket)
 *             {
 *                 my_ticket = ticket[k];
 *             }
 *         }
 *         ++my_ticket; // add 1, we want the next ticket
 *         entering[i] = false;
 *
 *         for(int j(0); j < num_threads; ++j)
 *         {
 *             // wait until thread j receives its ticket number
 *             while(entering[j])
 *             {
 *                 sleep();
 *             }
 *
 *             // there are several cases:
 *             //
 *             // (1) tickets that are 0 are not assigned so we can just go
 *             //     through
 *             //
 *             // (2) smaller tickets win over us (have a higher priority,)
 *             //     so if there is another thread with a smaller ticket
 *             //     sleep a little and try again; that ticket must go to
 *             //     zero to let us through that guard
 *             //
 *             // (3) if tickets are equal, compare the thread numbers and
 *             //     like the tickets, the smallest thread wins
 *             //
 *             while(ticket[j] != 0 && (ticket[j] < ticket[i] || (ticket[j] == ticket[i] && j < i))
 *             {
 *                 sleep();
 *             }
 *         }
 *     }
 *     
 *     // i is the thread number
 *     void unlock(int i)
 *     {
 *         // release our ticket
 *         ticket[i] = 0;
 *     }
 *   
 *     void SomeThread(int i)
 *     {
 *         while(true)
 *         {
 *             [...]
 *             // non-critical section...
 *             lock(i);
 *             // The critical section code goes here...
 *             unlock(i);
 *             // non-critical section...
 *             [...]
 *         }
 *     }
 * \endcode
 *
 * Note that there are two possible optimizations when actually
 * implementing the algorithm:
 *
 * \li You can enter (entering[i] = true), get your ticket,
 *     exit (entering[i] = false) and then get the list of
 *     still existing 'entering' processes. Once that list
 *     goes empty, we do not need to test the entering[j]
 *     anymore because any further entering[j] will be about
 *     processes with a larger ticket number and thus
 *     processes that will appear later in the list of tickets.
 *
 * \li By sorting (and they are) our ticket requests by ticket,
 *     server name, and process pid, we do not have to search
 *     for the smallest ticket. The smallest ticket is automatically
 *     first in that list! So all we have to do is: if not first,
 *     sleep() some more.
 *
 * \note
 * A Cassandra version is proposed on the following page. However,
 * because Cassandra always manages its data with tombstones, you
 * get a very large number of tombstones quickly in your database
 * (at least the CF that manages the lock.) Hence, we have our
 * own deamon which is much faster anyway because it only does work
 * in memory and through the network.
 *
 *   http://wiki.apache.org/cassandra/Locking
 *
 * \note
 * We also have our own Cassandra implementation in our
 * libQtCassandra library which is fully functional (look
 * at version 0.5.22).
 *
 *   https://snapwebsites.org/project/libqtcassandra
 *
 *
 * \section implementation Our implementation in snaplock
 *
 * Locks are given a name by our users. This is used to lock just
 * one small thing for any amount of time as required by your
 * implementation.
 *
 * That name is used as an index to the f_tickets object in the
 * snaplock class. Within such a ticket, you have one entry per
 * process trying to obtain that lock.
 *
 * For example, the users plugin generates a unique user identifier
 * which is a number starting at 1. When a process needs to do this,
 * we need a lock to prevent any other processes to do it at the
 * same time. We also use a QUORUM consistency in Cassandra to
 * load/increment/save the user number.
 *
 * In this example, all we need to lock is an object named something
 * like "user number". Actually, if the number is specific to a
 * website, we can use the website URI. In this case, we can use a
 * name like this: "http://www.example.com/user#number". This says
 * we are managing an atomic "#number" at address
 * "http://www.example.com/user". This also means we do not need
 * to block anyone if the other people need to lock a completely
 * different field (so process A can lock the user unique number
 * while process B could lock an invoice unique number.)
 *
 * As a result, the locking mechanism manages the locks on a per
 * lock name basis. In other words, if only two processes request
 * a lock simultaneously and the object_name parameter are not equal,
 * they both get their lock instantaneously (at least very quickly.)

 *
 *
 * \section drawback Any drawback?
 *
 * \subsection timeouts Timeouts
 *
 * Note that our locks have a timeout, by default it is very small
 * (5 seconds, which for a front end hit to a website is very
 * long already!) If that timeout is too short (i.e. a backend
 * does heavy lifting work on the data,) then you can make it
 * larger. Our backends are given 4h by default.
 *
 * \subsection deadlock Deadlock
 *
 * Like with any lock, if you have two processes that both try
 * two distinct locks each in the other order, you get a deadlock:
 *
 * P1 tries to get L1, and gets it;
 *
 * P2 tries to get L2, and gets it;
 *
 * P1 tries to get L2, and has to wait on P2;
 *
 * P2 tries to get L1, and creates a deadlock.
 *
 * The deadlock itself will be resolved once the lock times out,
 * but P2 will "never" have a chance to work on L1.
 *
 * \subsection one_lock One lock at a time.
 *
 * The process of obtaining a lock assumes that the process requesting
 * a lock gets blocked between the time it sends the request and the
 * time it receives the confirmation for that lock.
 *
 * This is very important because we manage objects coming from a
 * specific process as unique by using theid PID. If the same process
 * could send more than one lock request, the PID would be the same
 * and if trying to lock the same object twice, you would have a bug
 * because this system does not have any way to distinguish two
 * such requests if received simlutaneously.
 *
 * The lock should look as follow, although we have two implementations
 * one of which does no work in a local place like this because it
 * will be asynchronous.
 *
 * \code
 * {
 *   SnapLock lock("some name");
 *
 *   // do protected work here...
 * }
 * \endcode

/** \brief Initialize a ticket object.

 * The constructor initializes a ticket object by creating a ticket
 * key and allocating an entering object.
 *
 * Once the entering object was acknowledged by QUORUM snaplock

 * we can then create the ticket.
 *
 * \note
 * We create a key from the server name, client PID, and object
 * name for the entering process to run. This key will be unique
 * among all computers assuming (1) your client PID is unique and
 * (2) your servers all have unique names.

 * \note
 * If you use threads, or are likely to use threads, make sure to
 * use the gettid() function instead of getpid() to define a
 * unique client PID.
