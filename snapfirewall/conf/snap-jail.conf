# The fact that a computer attempts to connect to use via port 23 is a
# very clear signal that we do not want that IP to ever access us in
# any other way either.
#
# IMPORTANT NOTE:
# Uncomment if you want to use this one. Because of the IoT incredible
# extend, at this point we turn it off and just block the ports (23, 123
# and 2323) directly in the firewall before it even gets sent to the
# iptables.log file.

# If a user gets too many timeouts (35) then block him. Untfortunately we
# cannot make that count too small because this happens if legitimate users
# who would lose their Internet connection and as a result you can end up
# with many 408.
#
# TODO: At some point we'll need a fix for this one. Right now, Apache2 emits
#       many 408 for all sorts of reasons, not just Slowloris hits. It could
#       be that by tweaking the parameters we'd get the correct results, but
#       right now we do not have a way to verify that. There is a page which
#       says to use reqtimeout (done!) and use the modsecurity module. The
#       timings used in modsecurity is 5 x 408 within 1 minute instead of
#       our current setup of 35 within 1 hour (that means a whooping total of
#       300 x 408 in 1 hour, which seems really large to me.)
