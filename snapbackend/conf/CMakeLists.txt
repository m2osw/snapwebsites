## A snapwatchdog script to check out a blooper
##
## This script checks on the CRON script wrongly named snapbackend
## and installed by snapbackend. The CRON script that was actually for
## the snapbackup package to run a daily backup of the Cassandra database.
##
## This is here because it was installed by snapbackend and unless you purge
## snapbackend and reinstall it, it will stick around. Since snapmanager.cgi
## automatically does a purge when it removes a bundle, it either isn't there
## already or this script will detect it and let you know there is a problem.)
