/** \file
 * \brief Implementation of the snap_pid class.
 *
 * The snap_pid class is used to create a locked PID file which we keep
 * around while a service is running. It allows us to make sure only
 * one instance of a service is running. Attempting to run a second
 * instance will fail in the constructor.
 *
 * The destructor makes sure that the PID file gets unlocked and deleted.
 * It is generally not extremely useful, but it is not a bad thing to
 * clean up behind oneself.

 *
 * This function is going to create a PID file for the currently running
 * process.

 * fails, then the file is already held by another process so we can't
 * move forward (i.e. if another instance of the same service is already
 * running, the second isntance has to quit.)
 *
 * \note
 * We do not 100% guarantee that the current file always gets deleted on exit.
 * The lock tells us whether a process is gone or not. We are planning to
 * have a stronger rule for the delete to happen, though.
