 * \brief Implementation of the Snap Lock class.

 * This class is used to create an inter-process lock within a entire
 * Snap cluster.
 *
 * The class uses a blocking socket to communicate to a snaplock
 * instance and wait for the LOCKED event. Once received, it
 * let you run your code.
 *
 * If instead we receive a LOCKFAILED or UNLOCKED (on a timeout we may
 * get an UNLOCKED event) message as a response, then the class throws

/** \brief Initiate an inter-process lock.
 *
 * This constructor is used to obtain an inter-process lock.
 *
 * The lock will be effective on all the computers that have access to
 * the running snaplock instances you can connect to via snapcommunicator.
 *
 * The LOCK and other messages are sent to the snaplock daemon using
 * snapcommunicator.
 *
 * Note that the constructor creates a "lock service" which is given a
 * name which is "lock" and the current thread identifier and a unique
 * number. We use an additional unique number to make sure messages
 * sent to our old instance(s) do not make it to a newer instance, which
 * could be confusing and break the lock mechanism in case the user
 * was trying to get a lock multiple times on the same object.
 *
 * In a perfect world, the following shows what happens, message wise,
 * as far as the client is concerned. The snaplock sends many more
 * messages in order to obtain the lock (See src/snaplock/snaplock_ticket.cpp
 * for details about those events.)
 *
 * \note
 * The REGISTER message is sent from the constructor to initiate the
 * process. This function starts by receiving the READY message.
 *
 * \msc
 *    client,snapcommunicator,snaplock;
 *
 *    client->snapcommunicator [label="REGISTER"];

 *    client->snapcommunicator [label="UNLOCK"];
 *    snapcommunicator->snaplock [label="UNLOCK"];
 *    client->snapcommunicator [label="UNREGISTER"];
 * \endmsc
 *
 * If somehow the lock fails, we may receive LOCKFAILED or UNLOCKED instead
 * of the LOCK message.
 *
 * \warning
 * The g_unique_number and the other global variables are not handle
 * safely if you attempt locks in a multithread application. The
 * unicity of the lock name will still be correct because the name
 * includes the thread identifier (see gettid() function.) In a
 * multithread application, the initialize_...() function should be
 * called once by the main thread before the other threads get created.

/** \brief Check whether the lock timed out.
 *
 * This function checks whether an UNLOCKED was received while you hold
 * the lock. You cannot call the function if you did not yet obtain the
 * lock.
 *
 * If you are going to destroy the lock right away after determining that
 * it timed out, call the is_locked() function instead. The lock object
 * will automatically send an UNLOCK message when it gets destroyed so
 * just that is enough.
 *
 * Now, you want to use this lock_timedout() function in case you want
 * to test whether a lock is about to be released by the snaplock daemon
 * which took ownship of the lock. It will not send the UNLOCK event
 * back (acknowlegement). You are responsible to call the unlock()
 * function once this function returns true.
 *
 * This function is used on a snap_lock object that is kept around
 * for a while. If you are going to destroy the lock anyway, you
 * can just do that as soon as possible and you will be just fine.
 *
 * The following more or less shows a case where the lock_timedout()
 * and unlock() can be used. The lock_timedout() function can be
 * called any number of time, so if you do work in a loop, you can
 * safely call it once or twice per iteration:
 *
 * \code
 *  snap_lock l;
 *
 *  for(;;)
 *  {
 *      l.lock(...);
 *
 *      do
 *      {
 *          ...start synchronized work here...
 *          if(l.lock_timedout())
 *          {
 *              // make sure we unlock
 *              l.unlock();
 *              break;
 *          }
 *          ...more synchronized work
 *      }
 *      while(false);
 *  }
 * \endcode
 *
 * This example shows an explicit unlock() call. If you immediately
 * try a new lock() call, then the unlock() is call implicitely.
 *
 * \note
 * As mentioned above, you still got a little bit of time after this
 * function returns true. However, the sooner you call the unlock()
 * function after this function returns true, the safer.

 * \return true if the lock timed out, false otherwise.
