/** \brief Initialize a "new" flag.
 *

 * New flags are generally created using one of the SNAP_FLAG_UP()
 * or the SNAP_FLAG_DOWN() macros, which will automatically
 * initialize the flag, especially the source filename, the function name,
 * and the line number where the flag is being created, and the status
 * which the macro describes.
 *
 * All the names must match the following macro:
 *
 * \code
 *      [a-zA-Z][-a-zA-Z0-9]*
 * \endcode
 *
 * The underscore is not included in a name because we want to be able to
 * separate multiple names using the underscore, which is what is used
 * when building the filename from this information.
 *
 * \param[in] unit  The name of the unit creating this flag. For example,
 *            the core plugins would use "core-plugin".
 * \param[in] section  The name of the section creating this flag. In case
 *            of the core plugin, this should be the name of the plugin.
 * \param[in] name  The actual name of the flag. This is expected to
