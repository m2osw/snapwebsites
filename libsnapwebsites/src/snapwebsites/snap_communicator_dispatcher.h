/** \brief A template to create a list of messages to dispatch on receival.
 *
 * Whenever you receive messages, they can automatically get dispatched to
 * various functions using the dispatcher.
 *
 * You define a dispatcher_match array and then add a dispatcher to
 * your connection object.
 *
 * \code
 *      snap::dispatcher<my_connection>::dispatcher_match const my_messages[] =
 *      {
 *          {
 *              "HELP"
 *            , &my_connection::msg_help
 *            //, &dispatcher<my_connection>::dispatcher_match::one_to_one_match -- use default
 *          },
 *          {
 *              "STATUS"
 *            , &my_connection::msg_status
 *            //, &dispatcher<my_connection>::dispatcher_match::one_to_one_match -- use default
 *          },
 *          ... // other messages
 *
 *          // if you'd like you can end your list with a catch all which
 *          // generate the UNKNOWN message with the following (not required)
 *          // if you have that entry, your own process_message() function
 *          // will not get called
 *          {
 *              nullptr
 *            , &dispatcher<my_connection>::dispatcher_match::msg_reply_with_unknown
 *            , &dispatcher<my_connection>::dispatcher_match::always_match
 *          },
 *      };
 * \endcode
 *
 * In most cases you do not need to specify the matching function. It will
 * use the default which is a one to one match. So in the example above,
 * for "HELP", only a message with the command set to "HELP" will match.
 * When a match is found, the correcsponding function (msg_help() here)
 * gets called.
 *
 * Note that "functions" are actually offsets. You will get `this` defined
 * as expected when your function gets called. The one drawback is that
 * only a function of the connection you attach the dispatcher to can
 * be called from the dispatcher. This is because we want to have a
 * static table instead of a dynamic one created each time we start
 * a process (in a website server, many processes get started again and
 * again.)
 *
 * \note
 * The T parameter of this template is often referenced as a "connection"
 * because it is expected to be a connection. There is actually no such
 * constraint on that object. It just needs to understand the dispatcher
 * usage which is to call the dispatch() function whenever a message is
 * received. Also it needs to implement any f_execute() function as
 * defined in its dispatch_match vector.
 *
 * \note
 * This is documented here because it is a template and we cannot do
 * that in the .cpp (at least older versions of doxygen could not.)
