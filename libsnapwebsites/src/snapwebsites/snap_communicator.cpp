/** \file
 * \brief Implementation of the Snap Communicator class.
 *
 * This class wraps the C poll() interface in a C++ object with many types
 * of objects:
 *
 * \li Server Connections; for software that want to offer a port to
 *     which clients can connect to; the server will call accept()
 *     once a new client connection is ready; this results in a
 *     Server/Client connection object
 * \li Client Connections; for software that want to connect to
 *     a server; these expect the IP address and port to connect to
 * \li Server/Client Connections; for the server when it accepts a new
 *     connection; in this case the server gets a socket from accept()
 *     and creates one of these objects to handle the connection
 *
 * Using the poll() function is the easiest and allows us to listen
 * on pretty much any number of sockets (on my server it is limited
 * at 16,768 and frankly over 1,000 we probably will start to have
 * real slowness issues on small VPN servers.)

// Snap Communicator Message //
///////////////////////////////


/** \brief Parse a message from the specified paremeter.
 *
 * This function transformed the input string in a set of message
 * fields.
 *
 * The message format supported is:
 *
 * \code
 *      ( '<' sent-from-server ':' sent-from-service ' ')? ( ( server ':' )? service '/' )? command ' ' ( parameter_name '=' value ';' )*
 * \endcode
 *
 * The sender "<sent-from-server:sent-from-service" names are added by
 * snapcommunicator when it receives a message which is destined for
 * another service (i.e. not itself). This can be used by the receiver
 * to reply back to the exact same process if it is a requirement for that
 * message (i.e. a process that sends a LOCK message, for example,
 * expects to receive the LOCKED message back as an answer.) Note that
 * it is assumed that there cannot be more than one service named
 * 'service' per server. This is enforced by the snapcommunicator
 * REGISTER function.
 *
 * \code
 *      // to reply to the exact message sender, one can use the
 *      // following two lines of code:
 *      //
 *      reply.set_server(message.get_sent_from_server());
 *      reply.set_service(message.get_sent_from_service());
 *
 *      // or use the reply_to() helper function
 *      //
 *      reply.reply_to(message);
 * \endcode
 *
 * The space after the command cannot be there unless parameters follow.
 * Parameters must be separated by semi-colons.
 *
 * The value of a parameter gets quoted when it includes a ';'. Within
 * the quotes, a Double Quote can be escaped inside by adding a backslash
 * in front of it (\"). Newline characters (as well as return carriage)
 * are also escaped using \n and \r respectively. Finally, we have to
 * escape backslashes themselves by doubling them, so \ becomes \\.
 *
 * Note that only parameter values support absolutely any character.
 * All the other parameters are limited to the latin alphabet, digits,
 * and underscores ([A-Za-z0-9_]+). Also all commands are limited
 * to uppercase letters only.
 *
 * \note
 * The input message is not saved as a cached version of the message
 * because we assume it may not be 100% optimized (canonicalized.)
 *
 * \param[in] message  The string to convert into fields in this
 *                     message object.
 *
 * \return true if the message was succesfully parsed; false when an
 *         error occurs and in that case no fields get modified.

 * (i.e. snapcommunicator runs on all computers, snapwatchdog, snapfirewall,
 * snaplock, snapdbproxy are likely to run on most computers, etc.)
 * This parameter defines which computer the message came from. Thus,
 * you can use that information to send the message back to that
 * specific computer. The snapcommunicator on that computer will
 * then forward the message to the specified service instance.

 *
 * \note
 * IMPORTANT: Remember that POSIX signals stop your code at a 'breakable'
 * point which in many circumstances can create many problems unless
 * you make sure to mask signals while doing work. For example, you
 * could end up with a read() returning an error when the file you
 * are reading has absolutely no error but a dude decided to signal

 * \note
 * By default the constructor masks the specified \p posix_signal and

 * functioning of the SIGINT signal,) then make sure to call the
 * unblock_signal() function right after you create your connection.

 * make sure to create your snap_signal object early on or mask those

 * gets masked. Initialization of your process may not require
 * protection anyway.
 *
 * \bug
 * You should not use signal() and setup a handler for the same signal.

// Snap File Descriptor Connection //

/** \brief Initializes the file descriptor connection.
 *
 * This function creates a connection based on an existing file descriptor.
 * This is a class used to handle existing pipes or socket (opposed to other
 * implementations which create a pipe, open a socket, etc.) It is especially
 * useful if you want to listen to stdin and stdout. Use the `fileno()`
 * function to get the file descriptor and create a `snap_fd_connection`
 * object what that descriptor.
 *
 * The mode parameter defines how you are to use the file descriptor. In
 * other words, a socket that is read/write could be added to two different
 * `snap_fd_connection` objects: one to read and one to write, instead of
 * a single read/write object.
 *
 * Note that although you can say it's only going to be used in READ or
 * in WRITE mode, in all cases, make sure that the file is readable before
 * specifying READ or RW, and make sure that the file is writable before
 * specifying WRITE or RW.
 *
 * \note
 * It is important to note that the lifetime of the file desriptor is
 * not managed by this object. You are responsible for the descriptor to
 * stay valid as long as the connection is added to the snap_communicator
 * list of connections. If you want to close the connection, please first
 * remove the connection from the snap_communicator, destroy the connection,
 * then close the file descriptor.
 *
 * \note
 * It is possible to pass -1 (or any negative number) as the file
 * descriptor. In that case it is interpreted as "not a valid
 * file descriptor."
 *
 * \warning
 * If you are to use a read() or a write() that may block, make sure to
 * first set your file descriptor in non-blocking mode. If that's not
 * possible, then make sure to read or write only one byte at a time.
 * The loop will be slower, but you will avoid blocks which would
 * prevent the rest of the software from getting their own events.
 *
 * \param[in] fd  The file descriptor to handle.

/** \brief Initializes this TCP client message connection.
 *
 * This implementation creates what we call a permanent connection.
 * Such a connection may fail once in a while. In such circumstances,
 * the class automatically requests for a reconnection (see various
 * parameters in the regard below.) However, this causes one issue:
 * by default, the connection just never ends. When you are about
 * ready to close the connection, you must call the mark_done()
 * function first. This will tell the various error functions to
 * drop this connection instead of restarting it after a small pause.
 *
 * This constructor makes sure to initialize the timer and saves
 * the address, port, mode, pause, and use_thread parameters.
 *
 * The timer is first set to trigger immediately. This means the TCP
 * connection will be attempted as soon as possible (the next time
 * the run() loop is entered, it will time out immediately.) You
 * are free to call set_timeout_date() with a date in the future if
 * you prefer that the connect be attempted a little later.
 *
 * The \p pause parameter is used if the connection is lost and this
 * timer is used again to attempt a new connection. It will be reused
 * as long as the connection fails (as a delay). It has to be at least
 * 10 microseconds, although really you should not use less than 1
 * second (1000000). You may set the pause parameter to 0 in which case
 * you are responsible to set the delay (by default there will be no
 * delay and thus the timer will never time out.)
 *
 * To start with a delay, instead of trying to connect immediately,
 * you may pass a negative pause parameter. So for example to get the
 * first attempt 5 seconds after you created this object, you use
 * -5000000LL as the pause parameter.
 *
 * The \p use_thread parameter determines whether the connection should
 * be attempted in a thread (asynchroneously) or immediately (which means
 * the timeout callback may block for a while.) If the connection is to
 * a local server with an IP address specified as numbers (i.e. 127.0.0.1),
 * the thread is probably not required. For connections to a remote
 * computer, though, it certainly is important.
 *
 * \param[in] address  The address to listen on. It may be set to "0.0.0.0".
 * \param[in] port  The port to listen on.
 * \param[in] mode  The mode to use to open the connection.
 * \param[in] pause  The amount of time to wait before attempting a new
 *                   connection after a failure, in microseconds, or 0.
 * \param[in] use_thread  Whether a thread is used to connect to the
 *                        server.
