 * This variable represents the full library version at the time
 * you compile your program. To get the library you are linked
 * to at runtime use QCassandra::version().
 *
 * \warning
 * This variable uses an attribute supported by the GNU C++ compiler
 * which prevents Doxygen from finding this help block if declared
 * in the .cpp file. This is why it is in the header.
