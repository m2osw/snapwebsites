  * Added the snaplogger and cppthread as dependencies (for snapdatabase).
  * Added the snapdatabase project to handle journals.
  * Applied a fix to the snaplistd which would not properly reply when an
    error occurred. This may fix the problems we see where once in a while
    the list mechanism breaks.

 -- Alexis Wilke <alexis@m2osw.com>  Sun, 21 Apr 2019 00:14:19 -0700

snapwebsites (1.7.7.0~xenial) xenial; urgency=high

  * SNAP-181: Applied a fix as the whitelist would not update automatically,
    we have to save the value in the config (because it's static memory.)
  * SNAP-181: Fixed the `signal_secret` which would also not get updated.

    and CLUSTERDOWN had to be included.
  * SNAP-478: Fixed the type for result for a DELETE in the index plugin.

    CMakeLists.txt.
  * SNAP-478: implemented the index plugin to have instant "lists".
  * SNAP-478: added a link() function in snap_expr, useful for indexes.
  * SNAP-679: added a "temporary" fix to the fail2ban nice value.

  * SNAP-526: added the ability to add a secret code in a UDP message to
    make them a little more secure.
  * Changed the sendmail algorithm to allow for ignoring the fact that the
    user's email address failed with a bounce before if the user is an admin.
  * When marking a session as used up, save the date when the event happened.
  * Install the unblock-ip script even though it's not very useful as it stands.
  * Converted the snapcommunicator address test to make use of addr::addr
    (the domain name includes the port!)
  * Added a script one can use to search for users who have a bounced email.
  * Add the address to the addrinfo_t unique_ptr<>() because it could be that
    we had an error (r != 0) and a pointer (addrinfo != null).
  * Verify buffer length in get_client_addr().
  * Added support for keepalive in the client BIO.
  * Properly initialize a variable in case BIO_get_fd() fails.
  * Applied a fix to the snapmanager so it does not crash if the name of the
    host specified on the query string is unknown.
  * Fixed the cassandra plugin, if the "listen_address" is not defined it
    would _crash_ when trying to get the parameter when it's not defined.
  * Applied a fix to the snapstop making the `--service` parameter optional.
    (The `--service "$MAINPID"` becomes `--service` when $MAINPID is empty.)
  * Added /etc/vim/vimrc.local so we get our search, line numbers, etc.
  * Made the attach/detach session RAII so it at least happens on exceptions.
  * Added function to create a complete page in one call. (editor create_page)
  * Fixed the f_cassandra_connect_timer_index calculation.
  * Made the type found by find_type_with() available through another call.

    appear in the list.
  * Fixed HUGE bug in content::modified_content_impl() where I would return
    false if the snap_child object was ready. That test was inverted!
  * Various clean ups.

snapwebsites (1.6.20.0~xenial) xenial; urgency=high

  * Enabled the [named-resufed] jail now that SNAP-483 is complete.
  * Added a restart of bind9 to the DNS bundle.
  * Delete the bind9 logs on uninstallation.
  * We got some logs on one of our server so I could test the fail2ban
    named-refused.conf and it does not work as is. Here is a version that
    works (snap-named-refused.conf) and the necessary [un]install script.

snapwebsites (1.6.19.0~xenial) xenial; urgency=high

  * Updated the snapwatchdog server to use larger span times to send emails
    (changed from 15min, 1h, 1d, to 1d, 3d, 1w)
  * Made these spans and corresponding priorities editable (in conf file).
  * Applied a fix to the snap_communicator permanent connection thread, now we
    have to call the stop() function, no matter what.
  * Reviewed the rest of the snap_thread usage and it all looks good, except
    in snapmanagerdaemon where I put a TODO note.
  * Enhanced the dns_options tool to support adding acl bogusnets and logging
    options even when not defined at all in the options file.
  * Properly handle the case where multiple levels are missing on a CREATE.
  * Fixed some tabulations although there are still problems.
  * SNAP-553: Added the ACL DNS options in the DNS bundle.
  * SNAP-483: Added the log DNS options in the DNS bundle.
  * Added some missing std::endl in various messages.
  * Fixed the reading of the value of the expression on the command line, the
    get_token() needed to use `false` in that case.
  * Use more variables in the DNS bundle.
  * Added a test to verify all the dns_options we have in our bundle.

snapwebsites (1.6.18.0~xenial) xenial; urgency=high

  * Block IP address if user attempts to go to "wp-login.php" or
    "GponForm/diag_Form?images".
  * Updated the editor.js so we do not attempt to save if a file is being
    processed (i.e. our file drop areas immediately send the file to the
    server and attempting to Save to see would generate a "weird" error
    saying that the file is missing.)

snapwebsites (1.6.17.0~xenial) xenial; urgency=high

  * Moved the RAII lock object from finball to snap.
  * Use the RAII lock to increase the lock obtention when the content plugin
    tries to add an attachment, in case the file is being worked on.
  * Fixed the snaplog no_mysql() function to actually explicitly close the
    database (in case it was still open, to avoid "infinite" logs)
  * Added a catch() of the "failed lock" so we can die() with a 423 error
    (locked) instead of the default/usual not talkative 500 error.

 -- Alexis Wilke <alexis@m2osw.com>  Tue, 13 Oct 2018 23:02:55 -0700

snapwebsites (1.6.16.0~xenial) xenial; urgency=high

  * SNAP-663: the start() and stop() functions needed work to properly support
    the joining of our threads. They were not being joined so each time we
    would lose a lot of RAM and that's what I noticed in SNAP-663.
  * snap_thread: Fixed the start() function, when the pthread_create() fails,
    we must reset f_running back to false before returning.
  * libdbproxy: Show result and what was expected in a couple of errors.
  * log: Added support to log pointers.
  * tcp client/server: fixed the plain mode, deleter was not specified for
    the listen BIO object so delete would be used against a BIO object.
  * tcp client/server: added a couple of functions to ensure proper clean up
    of BIO objects. One to call when quitting a thread.
  * snapdbproxy: call tcp_client_server::cleanup() on exit.
  * start: added a test on $cmd so one can comment a command to avoid starting
    it from the start script.
  * snapdbproxy: check the ANEW flag when locked because if present we clear
    the g_cluster_description pointer which is a global!

  * Finished up an implementation of dns_options that is enough for SNAP-522.
  * Install dns_options.
  * Run dns_options when installing the DNS bundle.
  * Changed the use of the keywords and use shared pointers so we can have a
    parent (although I ended up not using the parent.)
  * Implemented the match() function.

snapwebsites (1.6.14.0~xenial) xenial; urgency=high

  * Applied a fix so the lock_connection object gets released: i.e. the
    dispatcher needed to use a weak pointer in case it's to itself.
  * Fixed the test which ensures at least 3 computers for leadership when
    the cluster is 3 or more computers.
  * Various clean ups.

  * Initialize start time in the constructor.
  * Set our start time in our constructor.
  * Immediately set the start time of new computers.
  * Moved the `if(set_my_leaders)` outside of the loop.
  * Added functions to access the is_locked() and lock_timedout() functions.
  * Removed the get_obtention_timeout_date() function since it wasn't used
    (and once we returned it's useless since we obtained the lock.)

snapwebsites (1.6.7.0~xenial) xenial; urgency=high

  * Fixed the CLUSTERUP/DOWN/[IN]COMPLETE neighbors_count so it gets reset
    when the count changes, which allows adding/removing neighbors dynamically.
  * Fixed updating the f_cluster_status as it can't be done when
    reply_connection is not a null pointer.
  * Added a start time to each snaplock so a LOCKSTARTED tells us whether this
    is a new snaplock or not (i.e. if we know that snaplock but its start time
    changed then it was restarted so it's considered new.)
  * Made the snaplock is_ready() function return false is the quorum changes
    and the results is that the election would not have occurred.
  * Force service name for LISTTICKETS to be "snaplock".

  * Move the flags out of the watchdog sub-directory since it may not be there.
  * Fixed the flags.cpp, removing the "watchdog" part since now it is in the
    library. Updated the rest of the code accordingly.
  * Moved the flag_path to the snapserver.conf file.
  * On a purge, attempt deleting the snapwebsites.d sub-directory.
  * Fixed the msg_help() as 'this' may represent a dispatcher_base directly.
  * Throw an error if the dispatcher can't find any command.
  * Raise a flag if you add a neighbor which is a loopback address.
  * Fixed the snaplock elections so they still work when we have less than
    three computers.
  * Fixed the usage of --debug-lock-messages in snaplock.
  * Mark ourselves as connected otherwise the election doesn't pick up.
  * Generate an error if the cluster is 3 or less computers and one or more
    is turned off.
  * Added a lock manager plugin to set up the candidate priority.

snapwebsites (1.6.3.0~xenial) xenial; urgency=high

  * SNAP-392: change our thread to Joinable instead of Detach.
  * SNAP-519: found out that the snapmanagerdaemon was not initializing the
    QCoreApplication so it could crash in the thread (albeit really rare.)
  * SNAP-661: move flags.cpp/h to libsnapwebsites so raising flags can happen
    from nearly anywhere.
  * SNAP-661: moved the raise_flag.cpp tool to libsnapwebsites/tools.
  * Moved 3 tools from snapserver to libsnapwebsites where they were supposed
    to be (there are there more to debug the library than really useful tools.)
  * SNAP-660: snapcommunicator tries to connect to any IP even invalid once,
    now we flag those that fail to connect for too long or too many times.
  * SNAP-350: added support for CLUSTERSTATUS, CLUSTERUP, CLUSTERDOWN,
    CLUSTERCOMPLETE and CLUSTERINCOMPLETE to snapcommunicator.
  * SNAP-350: replace LOCKREADY message with LOCKSTARTED so we can use the
    LOCKREADY to answer a LOCKSTATUS request (like CASSANDRAREADY, etc.)
  * SNAP-350: added a LOCKSTATUS, LOCKREADY, NOLOCK set of messages. This
    was a bonus because of the CLUSTERUP and CLUSTERDOWN messages from the
    snapmanager. We don't internally use those, but they will be used by
    other daemons (snapserver/snapbackend).
  * SNAP-533: change the LOCKSTARTUP (was LOCKREADY) to start the election
    process by counting the number of computers connected and use the CLUSTERUP
    total number of computers to know we attained a QUORUM of computers.
  * SNAP-350: added the LOCKLEADERS to complete an election by informing the
    others that the election was done and inform them of the leaders. New
    connections get a LOCKSTARTUP with the leader information.
  * SNAP-659: detect when a snaplock connection dies and act on it by
    conducting new elections and sharing the status of the locks with the
    new leader (LOCK and LOCKTICKETS messages are used.)
  * SNAP-533: prevent locks from starting until QUORUM is reached.
  * SNAP-471: the new implementation clearly uses 3 leaders and sends messages
    with a key which is unique so overlap cannot happen.
  * SNAP-343: locks now timeout as expected, snaplock sends an UNLOCKED at
    the time of the timeout (and wait for acknowledgment with an UNLOCK.)
  * SNAP-536: fixed the path to the snapserver-core-plugins documentation.
  * Fixed the source/destination of a few *-doc.install definitions.
  * Moved the additional libsnapwebsites docs to the libsnapwebsites directory
    instead of snapwebsites.
  * In threads, log a fatal error in case a thread throws an unknown exception.
  * Raise a flag in snap_child if the fork() happens with more than one thread.
  * Updated the debian/*docs for projects that have their own README.txt/md.
  * Added the necessary to temporarily change the logged log_level_t.
  * Reduce logs from snapwatchdog by raising log level to WARNING while running
    the plugins to reduce the logs by probably 10Mb or so...
  * Removed the unused `context` from a snap_backend connection.
  * Fixed the two glob_dir() to avoid empty directory errors in snapmanager.cgi
  * Reduced the number of database access of freshclam on installation.
  * Moved the snaplock code inside the snaplock namespace.
  * Swapped the order in which the "HELP" and "READY" messages are sent by
    the snapcommunicator as we want to get the "COMMANDS" back before any
    other messages (communication could otherwise fail.)
  * Updated any handling of the "HELP" or "READY" to take the new order in
    account (i.e. if things were started in "HELP" moved them to "READY".)
  * Added a function to determine the maximum pid_t that getpid() will return.
  * Added a way to read messages in a blocking snap communicator connection
    in between messages (needs more testing, though.) This can be useful for
    locks that last a long time.
  * Added an ALIVE -> ABSOLUTELY set of message as a watchdog that works with
    any daemon that implements the dispatcher.
  * Changed the dispatcher match() functions so they can return CALLBACK
    which means we can add a callback within our dispatcher tables.
  * Enhanced message of header of configuration files, including date too.
  * Implemented the dispatcher in snap_lock.cpp.
  * Added an unlock duration as UNLOCKED needs acknowledgment when due to a
    timeout.
  * Fixed the snapcommunicator count_live_connections().
  * In some cases a server name was needed in snapcommunicator and not added,
    now it will be so messages go straight to the correct server.
  * Fixed many lock failure error handling. We send more LOCKFAILED and
    snaplock daemons understand and can forward a LOCKFAILED to the service
    asking for a lock.
  * Removed the max_pending_connections in snaplock since it wasn't used.
  * Added a SIGPIPE handler to (1) ignore the signal and (2) log the event.
  * Added USR1 and USR2 in snaplock to get some info without stopping snaplock.
  * Fixed the log properties by adding a lock for all.log.
  * Various clean ups.

snapwebsites (1.6.2.0~xenial) xenial; urgency=high

  * Added the ability to prevent saving the snapwatchdog data to the Cassandra
    database to avoid possible slowness (maybe not so bad in terms of writes,
    but large number of TTL/tombstones handling can be slow from my experience)
  * Added the version, hostname, and count to the flags.
  * The flag now returns an error if the unlink() fails (permissions usually).

  * Made progress on the DNS options implementation, it compiles and runs
    the basic parser.
  * SNAP-54: because of SNAP-416 removed the plugin version test from debug
    versions for now.
  * In snapcommunicator, replace the is_enabled() with !is_connected() when
    we receive a GOSSIP and may need to restart a remote connection. Also
    fix the timeout delay back to 1 min.
  * Use the get_remote_address() instead of get_client_addr(). We ALWAYS need
    to use the remote (peer) address and not our own address.
  * Various clean ups.

snapwebsites (1.6.0.0~xenial) xenial; urgency=high

  * SNAP-657: Added an exception to avoid the 400 Bad Request on reboot.
  * SNAP-273: snapcommunicator would not properly re-enable the permanent
    connections used to connect with remove snapcommunicators when (1) it
    would receive a DISCONNECT message or (2) when it would receive a
    GOSSIP message (which was expected to restart the connection immediately)
  * Clear the possible '\r' at the end of messages in snap communicator.
  * SNAP-109: added a "packages" watchdog to check required, unwanted, and
    conflicting packages.
  * Added packages with the headers of the snapwatchdog library and plugins.
  * Added many .docs so docs get added to most of our packages.
  * Applied a fix to the snapbase script clearing the cache of old files
    so we do not get errors when the cache directory is empty.
  * Send a STOP message to snapmanagerdaemon in ./stop so it works.
  * Added my couple of commands to set up my developer environment in ./start.
  * Edited those scripts to use full paths.
  * Changed log level input in a select.

  * Added a function to get a path to the snapwatchdog path.
  * Added "flags" and "packages" as default watchdog plugins.
  * Fixed the default processes folder, it's /usr/share, not /var/lib.

  * Added a matrix is_diagonal() function.
  * Made the list error about chownnm() failure more verbose.
  * Changed the secure cookie code to generate a flag instead of failing in

  * SNAP-439: Thinking about it, the sendmail should not use the
    "SupplementaryGroups=postdrop" because that means itself and all the
    tools that it starts would have write privileges to that directory
    and I think that's much worse than "NoNewPrivileges=false".

snapwebsites (1.5.149.0~xenial) xenial; urgency=high

  * SNAP-439: Found that the problem with snapwatchdog sending emails was in
    link with the fact that we prevent the setgid() when starting snapwatchdog.
    I added the postdrop as a supplemental group.
  * Changed the "NoNewPrivileges" to false for the snapwatchdog service because
    our sendmail (from snapmta) requires root privileges.
  * Made snapimages, snaplistjournal use "NoNewPrivileges=true"
  * Changed snapsendmail to use "NoNewPrivileges=true" and have
    "SupplementaryGroups=postdrop", it worked for snapwatchdog
  * Made "NoNewPrivileges=false" explicity in snapinitfirewall,
    snapcommunicator, snapmanagerdaemon
  * Removed two SNAP_LOG_TRACE() from snaplog otherwise the logfile grows
    to incredible sizes (just on finball, a test system, it could reach
    64Mb!) The data goes to MySQL already, so no need for yet another dup.
  * Removed the alarm() because it would not be a good idea to leave sendmail
    processes running (i.e. us dying doesn't kill our children which pile up.)

  * Moved the watch_snapbackup_old_cron_script to snapbackend since that's
    where the rogue snapbackend (which was supposed to be snapbackup) was
    installed from, that's where it has to be found from.
  * Added a daily cron for snapwatchdog because the rusage files don't get
    deleted by logrotate, only emptied.
  * Removed the logrotate entry for the rusage directory.
  * Added many TRACEs for the sendmail failure to make sure I know where it
    fails.
  * Added a couple of forced writes to the watchdogscripts to see that it works.

snapwebsites (1.5.146.0~xenial) xenial; urgency=high

  * We don't actually want to run `snapbackend --action links::cleanuplinks`
    once a week; it is slow and it requires a URI to only run against one
    specific website, I converted the cron script in a command line for now.
  * Noticed `sendmail -f ...` being stuck on finball3 (which explains the
    lack of emails received from that system); (1) I put an alarm() so that
    way it doesn't get stuck forever; (2) I now make sure to flush the
    ostream before attempting to close the pipe.
  * Added a couple of tests in the snap_pipe implementation as it could
    otherwise attempt to use f_file with it's a null pointer.
  * Fixed the snapstop error in case kill(pid, 0) fails, it could be because
    the process is not accessible (i.e. kill() is not permitted.)
  * Worked on the dns_options implementation.

  * Fixed bug in snapwatchdogserver, the RELOADCONFIG was not yet implemented.
  * Fixed the default path to the watchdog_starter script, the 's' was missing.
  * Fixed the test of plugin names, check before adding the introducer.
  * Fixed the watchdog process plugin test for running services and backends,
    the fact is that we know whether a backend is expected to be running or
    not and can generate an error if running when it is disabled.
  * Fixed the match() function, whether a service is expected has nothing to
    do with matching the current process (ouch!)
  * Added a sleep() to slow down the login form when an invalid password is
    entered with the hope to slow down brute force login.
  * Fixed the counting of watchdog error messages.
  * Added a loop to go through the rows and columns of the links table to drop
    entries that point to destroyed pages.
  * Added a snapconfig command line tool to read and write configuration files.
  * Added a weekly CRON script to run the links::cleanuplinks process.

  * Fixed the AJAX URI with a slash (i.e. "/snapmanager" instead of just
    "snapmanager".) So if the path includes a slash it still works.
  * Fixed the snapstop --service with quotes so it receives an empty parameter
    when $MAINPID is not defined and does not generate an error in that case.
  * Fixed a bug in installer.cpp, a section may already exist when we do not
    find the specified variable by the end of the file.

  * Changed the bundle field to pointers instead of copying the whole thing.
  * Removed the one '!' in front of a package name (easy-rsa) and used the
    <conflicts> tag for the VPN client/server bundles.
  * Hide the fields if the bundles is not ready for installation (i.e. no
    need to offer the user a way to enter data when it won't be used.)
  * Changed the missing prereq or conflicts in warnings instead of errors
    because with 3rd party bundles it could happen that something is missing
    and we should not prevent other installations/removals because of such.
  * Delete the bundle status files in reset_aptcheck() to make sure that we
    get the new status after an update or installation.

snapwebsites (1.5.139.1~xenial) xenial; urgency=high

  * Fixed the bundle implementation so the status of a bundle is saved in

  * Found the way to define the bundle fields and not have to make all our
    fields public.
  * Fixed the check_status() function so when running snapmanager.cgi we don't
    use any of the very slow functionality.
  * Do not run the is-installed sript if we already know a package is not yet
    installed (no need and slow.)
  * Added anti-hacker code to prevent login into snapmanager.cgi after 5
    attempts (the number of attempts can be changed in the .conf file.)
  * Create a /var/cache/www-snapwebsites directory for www-data access of
    cache data and moved our sessions there. Adjust our code accordingly.
  * Added `std::string` and `char const *` to `chownnm()`.
  * Added support for `chmod()` and `chown()` to `mkdir_p()`
  * Updated several fail2ban regex to increase our chances to catch errors
    from postfix.
  * Various clean ups.

  * Added constructors/casts to go from and to snap_string_list
    (a.k.a. QStringList) and std::vector<> of std::string or QString objects.
  * Changed the "hide" flag using an attribute on the <bundle> tag instead
    of a '!' in front of a package name (which did not make sense.)
  * Added an <expected> tag to mark bundles we hope you will always install.
  * Added <a> tag and "id", "class", "href" attributes to the html type.
  * Added an id to the <tr> of each field so we can link to them.
  * Changed the <prereq> in a list of bundle names, no script.
  * Changed the <label> content to "html" instead of plain text.

    corresponding package status, and links (conflicts/prereqs).
  * In the form, renamed the list of options and initial value fields
    and function params.
  * Added a separate bundles plugin, that way bundles are now in a separate

  * Removed the postinst for loop that would manually disable the services.
  * Removing the preinst since we can use the preset instead. Although it
    looks like it worked, I have to test again with the new scripts.

  * SNAP-199: Added support for caches in snap.cgi.
  * To get the new cache to work properly, added a hack, see SNAP-650.
  * Possibly fixed a security issue in the die() funtion, it now calls the
    set_no_cache(true) to make sure that error pages don't get cached.
  * Fixed a bug with last_modified, if both are -1, we do not want a 304.
  * Added the ETag for CSS/JS files.
  * Mark the CSS/JS file as immutable which means avoiding many hits.
  * Changed the update_...()  functions in the cache to use minimum().
  * Added two cache directories so snap.cgi can save caheable files there.
  * Fixed HTTP Weighted Strings to support values and quoted strings.
  * Fixed the libdbproxy so snapcreatetables stops crashing creating tables.
  * Added the model name in the comment so looking at table descriptions gives
    us that info for when the table was created.
  * SNAP-442: Added a DESCRIBE CLUSTER ANEW so we can force a reload of the
    cluster meta data from the Cassandra cluster.
  * SNAP-399: Added support for Cache-Tag-like headers along cache_control.
  * Finally found the bug in the BIO class, when r == 0 we could end up
    returning -1 instead of 0. It's now returning 0 as expected.

    if() statements to a snap dispatcher used on itself and the messenger.
  * Removed a few logs that I used for debug purposes and inadvertendly
    checked in.
  * Removed the `systemctl stop <snapbackend service>` from the postrm:
    (1) it's automatically done in the prerm and (2) it would be too late,
    it has to be done in prerm.
  * Changed the try_dispatching_message() in a dispatch_message() since we
    can call process_message() from within it and save on many dual calls.
  * Handle the default snap communicator messages within the snap_communicator
    library object (HELP, LOG, QUITTING, READY, STOP, UNKNOWN)
  * Created a get_commands() to have an automatic "HELP" implementation.

    list_journal_path)
  * Added a new watchdog plugin to check out the list process.

  * Actually the journal_list objects must be allocated because we can't have
    a pointer to that object from a vector without the huge risk of having
    that pointer invalidated at some point. It also fixes the done() and
    destructor problems and I successfully create a company!

snapwebsites (1.5.101.0~xenial) xenial; urgency=high

  * Removed the test in the journal_list() destructor, it can't work because

  * In case of Qt dialogs/windows, I moved the #include "ui_*.h" file within
    the #pragma diagnostic so the derived class doesn't get us an error.
  * Removed the cell post ++ and -- because it returns itself and effective
    C++ says we should not have such. We're not using that feature anyway.
  * Added a copy and assignement operators to classes with a bare pointer.
  * Converted a struct + function in a lambda now that we have C++11.
  * Check for /var/mail/root emails, if present show a warning in the

  * Made the watchdog data file output shown in the snapmanager.cgi screens.
  * Added a menu entry to reach that page.
  * Tweaked the snapmanagercgi.cpp so it can have plugins generate the page
    output and add menu items.
  * Actually fixed the select="menu/select", it was supposed to be named:
    select="menu/status" instead and we really only expect one.
  * Made the images use "/..." instead of no slash.
  * Fixed the tests order in manager_cgi::verify() so they happen.
  * Made snapmanager.cgi symbols available to `dl`.

    surrounding which makes it easier to see which is selected.
  * Made small adjustments to the code to get the correct classes to help with
    the CSS of the tabs and the tab panels.
  * Added a snapmanager.cgi widget (a link really) to view watchdog results

  * Enhanced the processes check to avoid generating errors when the system
    backends were clearly disabled.

    to be active whenever the all_services is ON.
  * Properly implemented the Restore Default button of backend and watchdog.
  * Removed a couple of TODO that are actually done now.
  * Removed BACKENDALLSERVICES and force people to do a "Save Everywhere".

  * Allow for the mandatory flag to work in duplicated process definitions
    in the snapwatchdog XML files.
  * Try creating the folders if message for the snapmanager.cgi session.
    (Reality is that it's unlikely to work because Apache won't have
    permissions butat least I have better error messages.)
  * When trying to create a new session, do 10 attempts max. and fail.
  * Removed the default from/admin. emails from snapwatchdog.
  * Changed the WARNING in a HIGHLIGHT when snapwatchdog is disabled.
  * Added snapmanager.cgi fields to manage snapwatchdog emails and plugins.
  * Added snaplock as a mandatory process in a couple of places instead of

  * Added an error in case we detect snapcommunicator but can't connect to it.
  * Show an error message in the watchdog tab of snapmanager.cgi when no MTA

snapwebsites (1.5.84.0~xenial) xenial; urgency=high

  * Made snapwatchdog capable of running its plugins and RUSAGE even without

    reporting that Cassandra is down)
  * Added code to report errors found by the snapwatchdog plugins by sending
    an email to the site administrator_email user or email list.
  * Added a log rotate for the RUSAGE files since we use the PID for the name.
  * Added a cache folder for snapwatchdog CPU data.
  * Added support for a plugin introducer (i.e. the "watchdog_").
  * Made the firewall and cassandra plugins work in snapwatchdog.

  * Added XML files to check for processes (snaplog, snapserver, snaplistd,
    and snapwatchdog for the expected defaults)
  * Installed those XML files with process definitions.
  * Added validation of the process XML files to the CMakeLists.txt.

    now it won't just sit there.
  * Added a couple of exception and use those instead of std::...() ones.
  * Added the quoted_printable_encode_and_set_data() function to the email
    class so we don't have to duplicate that code over and over.

  * Added a mew configuration variable named `disk_ignore` to allow for regex
    to ignore partitions that are filled up.

    with our snap::process class.
  * Support two callbacks one for stdout and one for stderr.

    close() + dup() because race conditions can always happen.
  * Actually implemented the find_process tool used in the
    watch_firewall_fail2ban_client script.
  * Added a starter script so snapwatchdog scripts get kick started now
    giving us the /etc/default/snapwatchdog script for user settings.
  * Fixed the snapwatchdog server, we would add child process to the
    list of processes even if the fork() failed.

    over the network and is failing. It uses an alarm now.
  * Added a more detailed header so we know which computer is failing.

  * Use a weak pointer in one location that would lock up the snap_console.

  * process_message() is now defined in a separate class so we can have a
    default that throws if called. Useful if your dispatcher has a last entry
    which is a catch-all.
  * Added an always_match() function for the dispatcher catch-all entry.
  * Added a "reply with UNKNOWN" function.
  * Made all the send_message() functions return true or false.
  * Added logging in the snapmessage tool since we don't always get all the
    messages on screen (especially on a crash/quit situation.)
  * Various clean ups.

snapwebsites (1.5.34.0~xenial) xenial; urgency=high

  * Added Doug's script to stop Cassandra. It's working way better than just
    rebooting without first running that script.

snapwebsites (1.5.33.0~xenial) xenial; urgency=high

  * Added the snapmessage command line tool to test messaging between
    services from the command line (could use scripts, probably).
  * Allow for add_connection() to be called with a null pointer.

snapwebsites (1.5.32.0~xenial) xenial; urgency=high

  * Added the dispatcher template and sub-class.
  * Removed the process_message() from the 
    `snap_tcp_blocking_client_message_connection` class, it's not required
    since we have on in the `snap_tcp_client_message_connection`

snapwebsites (1.5.30.0~xenial) xenial; urgency=high

  * Fixed the path to the snapwebsites.org, it's HTTPS now.
  * Enhanced the --save-cell description in snapdb.
  * Use the pointer_t for advgetopt in snapdb.h instead of redefining it.
  * Added a parameter to the form error log for easier debugging.
  * Removed the WARNING of the server manager about typing the wrong name
    since Doug added a drop down and thus you can't make such a mistake.
  * Fixed a few #include for advgetopt which should always have used the path.

snapwebsites (1.5.29.1~xenial) xenial; urgency=high

  * Fixed the e-store settings, only the store_name field would get saved.
  * In the Stripe implementation, if store_name is not defined, cleanly
    generate an error (we may want to do that much earlier, though.)

 -- Alexis Wilke <alexis@m2osw.com>  Thu, 07 Dec 2017 01:43:17 -0700

snapwebsites (1.5.28.1~xenial) xenial; urgency=high

  * Fixed bug in libdbproxy, a contexts() call was not changed to getContexts()
  * Fixed the bug with consistency levels: the disconnect() resets it back to
    ONE and so if we want to use QUORUM it has to be set after. Note that
    QUORUM is currently forced because I missed that bug before! It is also
    safer with QUORUM always...
  * Applied various clean ups to the libdbproxy.
  * Updated the INSTALL file, although it should really be fixed 100%...
  * Fixed my start script since snapmanagerdaemon is now in .../snapmanager/.

snapwebsites (1.5.26.0~xenial) xenial; urgency=high

  * Fixed test websites: the canonical is not enough, we need to prevent
    search engines from indexing such sites by telling them NOINDEX.
  * Fixed reference to snapwebsites.org with HTTPS.
  * Fixed the tag name: X-Robots-Tag -- we were missing "-Tag".

 -- Alexis Wilke <alexis@m2osw.com>  Wed, 13 Sep 2017 15:28:14 -0700

snapwebsites (1.5.25.0~xenial) xenial; urgency=high

    a shared_ptr<>() object with a deletor that will always take care of that.
  * SNAP-289: Fixed the disabled_mode variable handling in backend.cpp.

    cannot misspell the word.

snapwebsites (1.5.23.0~xenial) xenial; urgency=high

snapwebsites (1.5.22.0~xenial) xenial; urgency=high

  * SNAP-591: Existing links may need to be deleted before we create new ones.
  * Added a couple of tests to verify that this is done properly for unique
    links (we want to check the same with multiple links too at some point).

 -- Alexis Wilke <alexis@m2osw.com>  Mon, 14 Aug 2017 21:57:06 -0700

snapwebsites (1.5.21.0~xenial) xenial; urgency=high

  * Noticed a warning from the filter and applied a fix (i.e. do not filter
    attributes of <xsl:...> tags because they include '[...]' specific to XSLT.

snapwebsites (1.5.16.0~xenial) xenial; urgency=high

  * The fix to the root user permissions actually exposed another bug: the
    updating of the cache could end up using an empty version of the list
    of permissions when we shortcut the calculation of the permissions to
    know whether the user is allowed (i.e. the default list is the empty
    list and we would save that even if we did not call the function used
    to generate the list of permissions of a page.)

snapwebsites (1.5.9.0~xenial) xenial; urgency=high

  * EX-79: Found out that if a page supports more than one image, then we must
    have a field name and not use "image" as that name. We may have a problem
    with the body which does not offer a separate field name for each image...

 -- Alexis Wilke <alexis@m2osw.com>  Sat, 08 Jul 2017 17:14:51 -0700

snapwebsites (1.5.8.0~xenial) xenial; urgency=high

    installed, and where the fail2ban action file was being put into the wrong
    directory.
  * Updated some manager-plugins to use the new `widget_select` for drop
    downs.

  * SNAP-222: Checking whether a file was properly added required to test
    with the correct path and not whether a file is attached to the field
    (because on Save we get a string, not the file which was already sent
    to use using AJAX.)

snapwebsites (1.5.2.0~xenial) xenial; urgency=high

  * SNAP-579: Split snaplistd/snaplog into a new bundle: mysql. These bundles
    both rely on the mysql bundle to be installed. And both bundles will
    manage their respective users and tables, removing them when purged.
