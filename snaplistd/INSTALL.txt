* Compile, Build, Install

This project uses cmake to generate the Makefile necessary to build the
project:

   tar xf snapwebsites-0.1.0.tar.gz
   mkdir build
   cd build
   cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=<where_you_want_it_to_go> ../snapwebsites-0.1.0
   make
   [sudo] make install

This should work on all Unices. We have not yet worked on the project to
get it to function under MS-Windows (although with all the fork() calls and
script execution, it is unlikely to even make it under MS-Windows.)


We also offer a few scripts that may help you in building snap. When you
check out the entire environment from the git repository, you get
two scripts in the top directory as follow:

1. snap-ubuntu-packages

This script installs all the packages required to run the build of snap.

2. build-snap

This script (re-)generates the entire Snap! environment. It put the
environment in a folder named BUILD. The script will fail if you did
not first run the snap-ubuntu-packages (or manually installed all
the necessary dependencies.)
